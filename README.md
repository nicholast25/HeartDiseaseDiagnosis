# Overview
This project aims to investigate the predictive performance of three supervised machine learning models: Logistic Regression with LASSO Regularization, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest Classifier for diagnosing heart disease, considering key factors associated with heart disease and their alignment with medical validation. Utilizing the Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset, the models were assessed on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The novelty of this study lies in its procedure to choose the best model while also tuning the parameters to optimize each model’s performance, and the verification to the medical review when interpreting the model.

# Key Messages
• The Logistic Regression model with LASSO achieved the highest accuracy (84.72%), precision (86.77%), and F1-score (82.20%), as well as demonstrated stronger alignment with medical reviews. The occurrence (for categorical feature) or increasing values of features related consisted of age, male, chest pain type (atypical angina and asymptomatic), ECG Result, exercise include angina, ST Peak Exercise ST Slope, number of major blood vessels affected, and thallium stress test result contributed to the increasing likelihood of heart diseases. 
• The Random Forest Classifier has the highest recall (84.77%), whereas SVM achieved lower overall metrics with an F1-score around 79.65% and was less likely to align with medical findings, as it tends to have discrepancies with some key clinical indicators.
